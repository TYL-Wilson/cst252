		<h2>Subject</h2>
		<p>The subject of this lab is to understand data types & variables for JS.</p>
	</div>

  <div class="column">
		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>I had some difficulties with the JS because I don't truly understand and know the content yet.
			I know that I did a bit of JS for basic calculations, but that's as far as I go.</p>
	</div>

<div class="column">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>My issue with this lab was getting the output to display. The information on the lab was wrong. My code needed to look like <br/> var make = document.writeln("Make: " + make + "<br>");
		It was mentioned during the lecture that var was left out, but the clarifcaton was not sufficent. W3Schools saved me! </p>
