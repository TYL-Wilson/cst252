			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<h3>The subject of this lab is to learn some additional JS functions. In this case, I will be working with
			events and forms in order to create some interactivity on my page. Getting the function / interaction of my
			pages in JS will help me participate in programming our final project site for users. This looks difficult, though.</h3>

			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<h3>My difficulty right now is time and burnout. I am submitting this lab a day late because of how steamrolled i'm getting by October.
			I am comfortable thus far, so I know I can get through a couple late assignments and still keep going strong. JS overall has been going smoothly.
			It's rough and tedious, but I know I am capable. Getting this button to work though, phew!.</h3>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<h3>In order to catch up, I used online help and the lab instructions to help shape my application of JS to apply forms & events easier than via html.
			It turned out pretty well, but I feel like I should database code for this sort of thing and just pull it when I need it.
			Thank you Kevin- I'm sorry for falling a bit behind in my turn ins this week.</h3>
