		<h2>Subject</h2>
		<p>The subject of this lab is to refresh us on proper file structure setup and uploading / transfering files</p>
	</div>

  <div class="column">
		<h2>Difficulties</h2>
		<p>The only difficulty I encountered in this lab was recalling how to make columns. I used W3Schools to help me</p>
	</div>

  <div class="column">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> I'm quite happy with my results, but I already knew how to do this stuff from last semester. I do however, like spending time to refresh on these topics.
			I noticed that this github preset set my files up to automatically draw from the site css. This made my color scheme carry over from my landing page, saving me a lot of time.</p>
