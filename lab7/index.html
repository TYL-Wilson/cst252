			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is JS functions. I will work within this opportunity to get a bit more comfortable
				with the topic. If I run into issues, I am going to be digging into the console to look for errors right way.</p>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>My biggest difficult with this lab is just understanding how to force functions to work. I have great disdain for
				programming, so this is pretty miserable for me. Despite that, I know I can overcome my hurdles by using
				 my resources.</p>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>It took a bit of figuring out how to sort & split a string, but I managed to work out copying my user-inuputted
				string to an array, which I could sort and split. A success overall!</p>
