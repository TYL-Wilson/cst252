			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is JS functions and calling those functions.</p>
		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>My difficulty in this lab was in recalling how to use callbacks. It's easier than I thought- instead of
			using some sort of weird command, I just assert the name of the function to execute it.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I didn't have trouble getting the function to work, but the way putting my JS in the head takes over my page
			and overlays the function on it's on screen, it's weird. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is, but my
		  functions and calls work fine.</p>
