			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is creating a sorting hat by using conditonals and other function commands. We need
			to put together a combination of functions, html, and event listeners which will fulfill this purpose. It's lengthy
			and difficult to understand how this stuff works, but I know I can get through it.</p> </br>

		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>My main difficulty in this lab was the big chunk of code needed at the end. I was able to do the sorting
			hat function and the conditionals on my own, but I needed to use the lab screenshots to do the event listener
			and getelementbyid parts. Those commands get confusing. In addition, small errors make it so tedious.
			I need to be diligent in using all my resources to try to make a working page.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I got it to work! I would say I'm pretty caught up and on time now, but still shakey due to the difficulty of
			using all these commands together. Once I understand where I need to seperate my code, it's a bit more clear.
			I wasn't sure until looking at the professor's example that I needed to split into 2 functions. I had a bunch of trouble
			after that, but it's because my button html div wans't closed. Simple mistakes!</p>
