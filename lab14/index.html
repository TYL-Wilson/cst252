			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is to set up constructors for defining objects.
			Both object variables and arrays must be functional for calls.</p>

		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>I didn't have much difficulty since I got all the information I needed
				in the lab. Objects are pretty clear to me on this level, but my next task
				is allowing users to define object variables themselves.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>My result was being able to output the array information easily onto my
				page from my function with getElementbyId. I'm getting the hang of how the
				HTML & JS cooperate.</p>
