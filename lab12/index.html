			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is to utilize loops to create repeated functions without hardcoding them over and over.</p> </br>

		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>This lab wasn't too difficult because I figured out the loop code during class. For me, it's not the way the
			function logic works that's hard, it's pulling it around and about to other places and what not that's difficult.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I was able to create a % 3 5 7 loop fairly easily, keeping in mind that I needed to run commands in order of priority,
			so that they would not overide eachother. It wasn't too bad, which is good since I'm currently struggling to work while sick.</p>
