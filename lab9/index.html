			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is understanding how to make CSS-like assignments via JS. I need to get comfortable
			with assigning, calling, and outputting. This one was kind of rough and stressful, but we got through it.</p>
		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>My difficulty in this lab was being unable to call fun variables by their ID. I needed to call variable names instead.
			I hope that once we get through this meat, it'll be easy as we understand core concepts better.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>With Kevin's help, I was able to call variables by their names rather than attempting to use
			getElementById. It was difficult until he showed me that I can just assign variables attributes in JS like in CSS</p>
