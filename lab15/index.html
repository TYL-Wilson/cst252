			<h2>Subject</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab is to covert from the prototype structure
			to using classes for our JavaScript. It's preferable to use classes
			because they are more capable of inheritence.</p>

		</div>

	  <div class="column">
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>This lab was quite easy because it just built off last
			constructor lab. I was able to utilize the same information
			inside of a different format to create working classes.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="column">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>My result was using classes to successfully output information
			into the output divs I targeted. It was a pretty fast process.</p>
